Coding or Programming is the way by which we can interact with computer.

Guys, Computer are really a dumb machine because they don’t understand English, Hindi or any other language.

CPU (Processor) only understands one language i.e. Machine language or binary digits {0, 1, 0, 1,1,0,0 ….}. And to write program in directly machine language or binary digits is really a very difficult task.

So, to overcome this problem we use Programming languages to communicate with computer.

Code written in programming language is converted by compiler or interpreter to machine language so that CPU can understand it and can perform the desired task.

There were many programming languages before C also such as BCPL, B etc. but C language got lots of hype because of its performance, easy to write code, ability to create big programs, efficiency and all.

C is a machine independent language which means we can use C language code in any machine and can compile it.

And Guys, to learn C++ language also we need to know C language because most of the C++ is same as C only.

C is one the fastest programming language. Since, it is low level language and there is a saying i.e. “Language which is most near to machine language is faster then the language which is more user-friendly” It means if the language is user-friendly then we have to compromise with speed but if the language is not much user-friendly then it gives the marvelous speed because it could be easily converted to machine language without doing much efforts.
