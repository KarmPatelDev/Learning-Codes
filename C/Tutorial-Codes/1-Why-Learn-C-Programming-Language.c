C Programming language is a computer programming language which was developed to do system programming for the OS UNIX & is on imperative programming language.

Before we dive into actual C language, let’s understand what the term Programming or Coding means?
What is programming?

    Programming or Coding is the way by which we can interact with computer and can give instructions to computer.
    Computer only understands Machine Language (Binary Digits).
    C is widely used programming language because it is reliable, simple and easy to use language. And because of these reasons only nowadays also C language is mostly used all over the world.
    C is a Low – Level Language as in C language the programmer has most of the control of the code.

What is C Language?

C is one of the fastest programming language as it is close to low-level languages such as Assembly language. If you are already familiar with programming, then you must know the demand out there for a C programmer. Because C comes in handy in case of all the applications that require fast processing, such as games, or major parts of different operating systems.
History Of C Language :

C Language was created by Dennis Ritchie at AT & T {American Telephone and Telegram (USA) } Bell Labs in 1972.
Benefits of C:

C was developed in early 1970’s but it is still in much demand and it doesn’t seem it is going anywhere, there are a lot of reasons for that such as:

    C takes only significant CPU time for interpretation. That is why a lot Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc. are built using C.
    Being close to Machine language, some of its functions including direct access to machine level hardware APIs
    It is a highly portable language
    Data structure and algorithm can be better implemented in C language.
    C is being used to support other programming languages to enhance their efficiency.

Features of C Language :

    C is very fast & efficient programming Language.
    It is Easy to learn Language.
    It has many pre-defined functions and operators which make complex program easy.
    It is one of the most powerful programming Language.
    C is mainly and largely used to make large-scale projects.

Importance of C Language :-

    C Programming is used when we need to extract best performance of the program.
    Most of the OS are developed by using C language only.
    In every developer survey result C language is always one of the ten programming language in the world.
    C language is mostly in demand in the software markets of the world.
    Because of C Language the hiring chance in any company becomes very high.

Scope:

Let’s talk about the scope of C, so you may know that you are not wasting for time with this Playlist. C has a wide range of scope

    Windows, Linux, Mac all are mostly written in C. Linux is written 97% using C.
    C has also been used widely while creating iOS and Android kernels.
    MySQL database is written using C.
    Ruby and Pearl are mostly written using C.
    Most part of Apache and NGINX is written using C.
    Embedded Systems are created using C

IDE and Compiler

IDE – IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application which provides many comprehensive facilities to programmers for software or application development.

    Ide provide tools to create build and test software’s. It also provides programmable editors, libraries, build automation tools etc.
    It has features like syntax highlighting, syntax checking etc.
    E.g. Net Beans, Microsoft Visual Studio etc.

Compiler – It’s a software that transforms computer code written in one programming language into another language i.e. machine language.

    It translates the source code to machine code so that it can be executed by the computer.
    E.g. GNU Gcc etc.

Control:

C gives most of the control in the hand of users. Things like memory allocation and manipulation are totally in the hands of the programmer. Being a flexible language, it provides more access to the programmer because of which it is more efficient.

All of these reasons make C one of the widely used Programming language having special respect in the heart of programmers.
Summary:

C is not a hard language to learn and along with that it stills has a scope in the future. It is a low-level programming language that makes it more efficient and swifter. So many devices and applications are build completely or partially using C, so there is a wide range of options related to field you want to get into.
